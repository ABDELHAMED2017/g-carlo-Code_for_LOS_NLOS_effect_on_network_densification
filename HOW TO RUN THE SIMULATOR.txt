This repository contains the Matlab code to test the stochatic-geometry based 
model presented in the paper "Effect of LOS/NLOS Propagation on 5G Ultra-Dense
Networks", submitted to "COMPUTER NETWORKS, Elsevier" and currently under review.

This code has been tested for Matlab 2016a and 2015a.

The repository includes several scripts/functions, which performs the following:

- "sim_script_fully_loaded_network.m": This runs a simulation of the model for
  fully loaded networks, and returns vectors of "SIR" values, "coverage" values
  as the probability Prob[SIR > SIR_threshold], and the Area Spectral Efficiency
  (ASE) values. This script can be run as a stand-alone .m file in Matlab.

- "sim_script_fully_loaded_network_freq_reuse.m": This runs a simulation of the
  model for fully loaded networks, for different frequency reuse factors for
  frequency ALOHA medium access technique. It returns vectors of "SIR" values,
  "coverage" values as the probability Prob[SIR > SIR_threshold], and the Area
  Spectral Efficiency (ASE) values. This script can be run as a stand-alone .m
  file in Matlab.

- "sim_script_partially_loaded_network.m": This runs a simulation of the
  model for partially loaded networks. It returns vectors of "SIR" values,
  "coverage" values as the probability Prob[SIR > SIR_threshold], and the Area
  Spectral Efficiency (ASE) values. This script can be run as a stand-alone .m
  file in Matlab.

- "launch_check_p_A_LOS_NLOS.m": This runs a simulation of the model for
  partially loaded networks. It runs a benchmark of the analytical expression of
  the probability of a base station being active (as a function of the user and
  base station densities) against the simulation results. It calls the function
  "fnc_check_p_Active_LOS_NLOS.m" and plot the simulated and analytical curves
  of p_active as a function of the user desnity over the base station density.
  This script can be run as a stand-alone .m file in Matlab.

- "fnc_check_p_Active_LOS_NLOS.m": this function is called by
  "launch_check_p_A_LOS_NLOS.m".
